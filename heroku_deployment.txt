This file outlines the steps needed to push MDS as a standalone Django app on heroku.
Note this file assumes that a heroku postgres database has already been configured for the
heroku app. 

1. Using the heroku config:set command, set the Django secret key, i.e
	heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=INSERT_KEY_HERE
2. In the source code, find all imports from of django-piston (i.e. import piston) and replace 
with django-piston3 (i.e. import piston3)
3. In ./src/mds/heroku_settings, copy both templates files into ./src/mds as settings.py and local_settings.py respectively
4. In ./src, create a directory named "staticfiles" and create a placeholder file inside (i.e. Placeholder.text)
5. Remove line 474 in ./src/mds/web/views.py
6. Run 2to3 across the entire codebase to convert from python 2 to python 3
7. In ./src/mds/core/static/css, remove the jquery.mobile-1.4.0* files

Then push the app to heroku via git push heroku master

Notes
----------

Steps 2 and 6 are necessary as heroku deployment relies on heroku_django package which needs Python 3.
Step 4 is necessary for serving static files. The placeholder file in the directory allows the directory to be pushed to git
Step 7 is necessary as otherwise the collectstatic step fails due to a missing file (further investigation needed)
